    question: "Differentiate between var, const, and let variables.",
    answer:
      "Var can be changed and redeclared. Let can be changed but not redeclared. Const can't be changed or redeclared.",
    example:
      "var x = 1; x = 2; var x = 3; // ok, let y = 1; y = 2; // ok, but let y = 3; // error, const z = 1; z = 2; // error",

      "Variables are like boxes for storing things. Var is like an old box that lets you change what's inside and even replace the box. Let is like a new box that lets you change inside but not replace the box. Const is like a locked box that you can't change at all.",
    realTimeExample2:
      "Think of var as a chalkboard where you can write, erase, and rewrite anything. Let is like a notebook where you can write and erase, but you can't replace the whole notebook. Const is like a tattooâ€”once it's there, it stays exactly as it is.",

    question: "Differentiate between Angular and AngularJS",
    answer:
      "Angular uses TypeScript and supports mobile devices. AngularJS uses JavaScript and doesn't support mobile devices. Angular has components, AngularJS has MVC. Angular has dependency injection, AngularJS doesn't.",
    example:
      "AngularJS uses JavaScript like plain talk, Angular uses TypeScript like typed talk for better checks.",
    realTimeExample:
      "Angular is like a modern car with safety features, AngularJS is like an old car without them. Angular supports phones, AngularJS doesn't. Angular has parts like Lego blocks, AngularJS has a different way.",

    realTimeExample:
      "Synchronous is like waiting in line at a coffee shop: you order, wait for your coffee, then get it before the next person can order. Asynchronous is like ordering at a fast food drive-thru: you order, drive to the window, and while you wait, other cars can order too.",
    realTimeExample2:
      "Think of synchronous code as reading a book page by page. You can't skip ahead or do anything else until you finish the current page.

    question: "How to implement lazy loading in Angular?",
    answer:
      "Generate modules using 'ng generate module modulea --route a --module app.module'. Then configure routes in app-routing.module.ts for lazy loading.",
    example:
      "Lazy loading loads feature modules only when navigated to, improving initial load time.",

    question: "What is Change Detection in Angular?",
    answer:
      "Change detection in Angular is the process by which Angular checks for changes in component data and updates the DOM accordingly. It ensures that the view always reflects the current state of the data.",
    example:
      "Angular's change detection can be triggered by events, timers, or HTTP responses, and it compares current and previous values to determine if the view needs updating.",
    realTimeExample:
      "Change detection is like a security camera system that constantly monitors a room (component). When it detects movement (data change), it alerts the guards (Angular) to check the monitors (update the view). The system ensures that the guards always have an accurate picture of what's happening in the room.",
    realTimeExample2:
      "Imagine change detection as a teacher watching students during a test. The teacher (Angular) constantly scans the room (component) for any changes, like a student raising their hand (data change). When a change is detected, the teacher updates their records (view) to reflect the new situation, ensuring everything stays accurate and up-to-date.",

    question: "What is OnPush Change Detection Strategy?",
    answer:
      "OnPush is a change detection strategy in Angular that only checks a component when its input properties change or when an event originates from the component or one of its children. This improves performance by reducing the number of checks.",
    example:
      "OnPush is useful for components that don't change often or have complex data that doesn't need frequent checking.",
    realTimeExample:
      "OnPush is like a motion-activated security light. It only turns on (checks for changes) when someone moves nearby (input changes) or when there's activity in the area (component events). This saves energy (improves performance) compared to a light that's always on (default change detection).",
    realTimeExample2:
      "Imagine OnPush as a library's 'new books' alert system. You only get notified (change detection runs) when new books arrive in your favorite section (input changes) or when you request a book (component event). This is more efficient than checking every shelf every day (default change detection).",
    syntax: "changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush",

    question: "What is the purpose of ngZone?",
    answer:
      "NgZone in Angular is a service for executing functions inside or outside of the Angular zone. It helps Angular detect when asynchronous operations (like timers or AJAX calls) complete and trigger change detection.",
    example:
      "NgZone is used to optimize performance by controlling when change detection runs, especially for operations outside Angular's normal flow.",
    realTimeExample:
      "NgZone is like a border control at a country's entrance. Operations inside the border (Angular zone) automatically trigger customs checks (change detection). Operations outside the border need to go through customs manually. NgZone helps manage this process, ensuring that all relevant operations are properly checked.",
    realTimeExample2:
      "Imagine NgZone as a stage manager in a theater. Performances on stage (inside Angular zone) automatically get applause (change detection). Performances backstage (outside Angular zone) need to be announced to the audience. NgZone helps coordinate these announcements, making sure the audience reacts appropriately to all performances.",

    question: "What is the purpose of ViewChild?",
    answer:
      "ViewChild in Angular is a decorator that allows you to get a reference to a child component, directive, or DOM element from the parent component class. This enables direct interaction with child elements.",
    example:
      "ViewChild is commonly used to access child components or DOM elements for direct manipulation or to call their methods.",
    realTimeExample:
      "ViewChild is like having a direct phone line to a specific department in a company. Instead of going through the main switchboard (DOM queries), you can call that department (child element) directly to get information or give instructions. This makes communication faster and more precise.",
    realTimeExample2:
      "Imagine ViewChild as a remote control for a specific TV in a large house. Instead of walking to each room to change the channel, you can directly control the TV in the living room (child component) from your bedroom (parent component).

    question: "What is Content Projection?",
    answer:
      "Content Projection in Angular is a technique that allows you to insert content from a parent component into a child component's template at a location specified by the <ng-content> tag. This enables the creation of more flexible and reusable components.",
    example:
      "Content projection is used to create wrapper components that can display dynamic content provided by their parent.",
    realTimeExample:
      "Content projection is like a picture frame with a removable back. You can insert any photo (content) you want into the frame (child component), and the frame will display it beautifully. The frame doesn't care what photo you use; it just provides a nice way to show it off.",
